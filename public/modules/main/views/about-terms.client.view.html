      <h2>About Art Advisor</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Art Advisor is a free-to-use global platform for finding, sharing and recommending art happenings around you. Our dream is to make art an accessible part of everyday life experiences and discourses all around the world. We promote everything from grassroot artists’ studios to highly established art institutions. We don’t curate it, you do!</p>

      <p>We respect the art content and our user’s privacy. Art Advisor does not serve advertisements and does not sell information about its users to third parties. We don’t claim ownership over any Content that you post on the Art Advisor Services. Mutually we expect that you as a user have the rights and permission to the content that you post in our services. Also, only input valid art events and artist info. Other than fine art related events will be removed from Art Advisor. Please read more in our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor is a service provided by Finnish non-profit artist-run company called Kunstventures Oy. The development and initial launch of Art Advisor has been kindly supported by Finnish cultural funds, namely Konstsamfundet, AVEK and Koneen säätiö. We are deeply grateful for the support our initiative has been blessed with now and in future.
      Art Advisor is a non-profit service, and is free for you to use in all it’s basic functions, but for the maintenance and upkeep, we will need to generate donation and grant based funding. If you feel the need and have the possibility to patron our cause, please contact support@artadvisor.fi.</p>

      <h2>Art Advisor Terms of Use</h2>
      <h4>created 19.10.2015</h4>
      <p></p>
      <p>We highly recommend that you read Art Advisor’s Terms of Use (“Terms”). The Terms are a contract between you and Kunstventures Oy, Art Advisor App (“Art Advisor”, “us”, “we”), which is applicable when you use our Art Advisor websites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Art Advisor, globally, in existence now or in the future (“Art Advisor Services” or “Service”).</p>

      <p>By accessing or using the Art Advisor Services (whether or not you create a member account), you agree to be bound to the Terms. That means that if you don’t agree to these Terms, please don’t use the Art Advisor Services. Additionally, you must abide by our Rules, which are found below, and are incorporated into the Terms. Please read the Rules, which include important rules and guidelines governing the behavior we expect of Art Advisor Services users.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor may update these Terms from time to time. We will let you know if we make significant changes by sending a notice to the email address connected with your Art Advisor Services account, or by placing a notice in a prominent place on our web site. If we make a significant change, the notice we provide will indicate when the change will be effective. If you do not agree with the upcoming change, please delete your account. If you continue to use the Art Advisory Services after the stated effective date, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.</p>

      <p>To be eligible to use the Art Advisor Services, you must be at least 18 years old, you must be old enough to enter into a contract with Art Advisor, and you must have a valid email address. You must create an account to post content on the Art Advisory Services and to access other features offered only to account holders. We require an email address, password and your name. The system automatically generates a unique username for each user – which you can change later in the Settings. Please notice that your name is the public name of you as a user in the system – the username is only to identify people with same names from each other.</p>

      <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password. Art Advisor cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>

      <p>You must provide an email address that is actually yours. When you sign up to become an Art Advisor Services member, you will also be asked to type your name and choose a password. The name you type will be your public name in the Service, so if you are an artist, you should use your artist name. Art Advisor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) refuse to issue a particular name/username chosen, or (b) remove or reclaim any name/username. For instance, we may refuse to issue a name/username or reclaim a name/username if a third party that owns a trademark complains that a name/username violates that third party’s intellectual property rights, or if we determine that such name/username impersonates someone else, misappropriates a person’s right of publicity, is illegal, or offensive. Your name is how you will be publicly identified, along with any photo you associate with your account. The username is just for technical purposes to identify users with same name.</p>

      <p>When You Post on the Art Advisor Services</p>

      <p>We don’t claim ownership over any Content that you post on the Art Advisor Services. “Content” means any content or creative expression that you’re able to upload or post on the Art Advisor Services, including text, images, files, animations, logos, comments, or otherwise.

For example, your content can be publicly displayed in the venue, event and artist pages of the Art Advisor Service as well as used in the Art View image carousel, in our Newsletter where we tell about recommended shows, and in Art Advisor Services own marketing such as screen captures of the site for demonstration and promotion purposes.</p>

      <p><strong>You are responsible for the Content you submit to the Art Advisor Services.</strong> You assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual property claims, or any other legal rights claims. You represent and warrant that (i) you either own the Content you post, or that you have all necessary rights to post that Content on the Art Advisor Services, (ii) your Content does not infringe any third party’s rights, and (iii) you can grant the licenses you grant in these Terms.

However, as mentioned above, other Art Advisor Services users may distribute and share your Content outside of the Art Advisor Services.</p>

      <p>At any time, you may request us to delete your Content from the Art Advisor Services, or delete your account. Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time, with or without notice. When your account is terminated, you no longer have the right to access or use the Art Advisor Services. When you request us to delete Content or your account is terminated, we will use reasonable efforts to remove all of your Content from the Art Advisor Services. However, there may be a delay between your request and when the Content or account is publicly visible due to technical or operational limitations. Note that we do retain backups of Content on our servers, and some of your Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly visible) even after you ask to have it deleted. If you delete your account or Content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.</p>

We may delete or modify any part or all of this Service at any time, without notice. We may add features and functionality from time to time, and we reserve the right to limit use of certain features or functions.</p>

      <p>User Activity</p>

      <p>If you haven’t uploaded a profile picture or header image within 60 days of creating your account, we may remove your account and allow another user to select your username. Also, if you haven’t logged into your account for 365 days, we may delete your account to make room for new users.</p>

      <p>If you use a robot to post on the Art Advisor Services, or to sign up for multiple accounts, or to follow lots of other users, we may delete your account. If you follow too many other users we may delete your account if we feel you are not acting like a human being.</p>

      <h2>Art Advisor Rules</h2>
      <h4>created 19.10.2015</h4>

      <p>We of course believe that these are totally obvious to you as a respectful, thoughtful and loving person, but we urge everybody to keep in mind that:</p>

      <p>Don’t post any personal information of any other users or third parties unless you have express permission from them to do so. Don’t use Art Advisor to intrude on other people’s privacy.</p>

      <p>Don’t spam. Only input valid art events and artist info. Other than fine art related events will be removed from Art Advisor.</p>

      <p>Don’t automate. Art Advisor is for human beings. It is against the rules to use a computer to register a lot of users on Art Advisor.</p>

      <p>Don’t post content that belongs to third parties without their consent. Please make sure you have the right to post the content that you put on Art Advisor. In other words, only post content that you own or have permission to post.</p>

      <p>Only post content that is legal, meaning you can’t post content that violates a law, rule or regulation.</p>

      <p>Don’t register a username that you are not going to use yourself. Don’t sell your username. Don’t register a username just to prevent someone else from using it. Usernames that have not been actively used for an extended period will be reclaimed.</p>

      <p>Don’t impersonate others. Please don’t pretend to be someone else.</p>

      <p>Don’t try to circumvent or compromise our security or access non-public areas of the Art Advisor website. Don’t use robots or other automated technology to access Art Advisor. Do not scrape content from Art Advisor. Don’t overload our servers with traffic. Don’t upload or distribute viruses or malware to or through Art Advisor.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor’s rules expressly forbid posting abusive content of any kind, including content of any kind that portrays or encourages violence towards people or animals. Hate speech, including denigrating comments involving race, sexual orientation, religious or political belief, age, whether they be personal or general, are not allowed.</p>

      <p>If you break the rules we may contact you and ask you to fix the problem immediately.</p>

      <p>If you don’t, your account may be suspended or deleted, your username forfeited, and your IP address may be permanently banned from logging into Art Advisor. We reserve the right to enforce or not to enforce these rules in whatever way we see fit, at our sole discretion.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor’s rules and policies do not create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner. Art Advisor reserves the right to change these rules at any time.</p>

      <p>If you notice abusive behavior, please report it immediately by emailing report@artadvisor.fi and we will look into it, and take necessary action as soon as possible. This email box is strictly for reporting abuse, and we will not respond to other requests sent here.</p>
