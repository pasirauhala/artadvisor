      <h2>Art Advisor Privacy Policy</h2>
      <h4>created 19.10.2015</h4>
      <p></p>
      <p>Your Privacy is Important. Kunstventures Oy, Art Advisor App (“Art Advisor”) takes data privacy seriously as a network that does not serve advertisements and that does not sell information about its users or use of the Site (defined below) to third parties.</p>

      <p>Please read this document in its entirety. It explains Art Advisor’s privacy practices, and what information we collect when you use our web site located at www.artadvisor.fi and related mobile apps (collectively, the “Site”).</p>

      <p>Information Art Advisor Collects</p>

      <p>When you visit The Site, we may collect and store general, non-identifiable information about what pages you access, your general geographic location (e.g., a city, but not a street address), the device you are using, an anonymized version of your IP address, and the address of web sites that refer you to the Site. We also store your email address and UserID that you choose when you register for an account.</p>

      <p>We may use this information to protect Art Advisor and its users from spam, viruses, identity theft, illegal or harmful activities, as well as to understand how people use the Site, which features work and which don’t, and to help us develop and improve the Site’s features and services. For example, if we create a feature that everybody is using, we want to know about that, so we collect data about how much different features are used. We may create anonymous records by excluding personally identifiable information (such as your name) from records.</p>

      <p>We also collect any information you provide us if you choose to contact us directly or post on our web site or on your page, including any personally identifiable information. We use this information for the purpose you provided it – for instance, to provide support or answer questions – and to provide you the Site.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor uses an anonymized version of Google Analytics and Segment to gather and aggregate general information about user behavior. Google/Segment may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling reports on site activity for us and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage. Google/Segment may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google/Segment’s behalf. To the best of our knowledge, the information gathered by Google/Segment on Art Advisor’s behalf is collected in such a way that neither Art Advisor, nor Google/Segment, can easily trace saved information back to any individual user.</p>

      <p>If you want to invite a friend to the Site, you will need to provide us their email address.</p>

      <p>Email Communications</p>

      <p>From time to time we may email you information about Art Advisor that we think is necessary and important. By opening or maintaining an account with Art Advisor, you agree to receive administrative emails as part of your basic service. You can always opt-out of non-administrative emails.</p>

      <p>If anyone ever contacts you and asks for your Art Advisor password, they are probably trying to scam you. Art Advisor will never do this. Please don’t give your Art Advisor password to anyone, and let us know about it so we can hunt them down and execute suitable punishment.</p>

      <p>Information Sharing</p>

      <p>Art Advisor does not make money from selling advertising on the site, serving ads to you, or selling information about our users to third parties, including advertisers, data brokers, search engines, or anyone else.</p>

      <p>We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties under several circumstances, including (1) if you tell us it is OK to do so (2) if we believe that we need to do so to comply with applicable law or legal obligations (3) if we contract with a third party service provider to offer services for you — for example, with a credit card processing company if you decide to buy something through the Site.</p>

      <p>Kunstventures Oy, Art Advisor App does not have any affiliated companies right now. But if we do in the future, we may share information with them, too.</p>

      <p>We will do our best to resist baseless legal requests to access information. However, we may disclose your information or content to satisfy a law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order. Art Advisor’s policy is to give you, advance notice if we are going to release your information unless by law we are prohibited from or advised against doing so. If we think that by disclosing your information we may prevent serious harm to Art Advisor, its users, you, or anyone else for that matter, we may do so without notifying you. Finally, we may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address safety, fraud, or security concerns related to Art Advisor.</p>

      <p>Art Advisor is a Public Network</p>

      <p>The Site is a platform built for posting and sharing content publicly. You should assume that anything you post or upload on the Site other than private messages will be accessed by the public.</p>

      <p>However, we may store backups of your content on our servers, even after it is deleted or after your account is deleted.</p>
